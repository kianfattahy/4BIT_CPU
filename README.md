# Custom 4-bit Computer
4-bit computer designed in Logisim, built from the ground up with standard digital circuit components.

## üìå Key Components & Features

- **Address Registers**: Data storage and retrieval operations.
- **Program Counter**: Systematically tracks instruction execution.
- **MAR & MBR**: Core registers that manage memory interactions.
- **Instruction Register (IR)**: Decodes and holds the active instruction.
- **Control Unit**: Orchestrates harmonized operations across the architecture.
- **4-bit RAM**: Optimized storage solution for 4-bit tasks.
- **General-purpose Registers (R0 & R1)**: Temporary data registers.
- **ALU Registers**: Interface with the Arithmetic Logic Unit for computational tasks.
- **Status Register**: Provides insights into the system's operational state.
- **Central Bus System**: Ensures fluid communication amongst components.
- **Binary-to-Decimal Converter**: Converts binary outputs for enhanced readability.
- **Nums Machine**: Displays computational results.
